            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Hello, I'm Pallavi. a dedicated and curious student with a strong interest in learning and self-improvement, especially in the field of technology. I enjoy exploring web development and programming, where I am building a solid foundation in HTML, CSS, and basic coding concepts. I believe that consistent practice and hands-on learning are the best ways to grow, and I always try to understand concepts clearly rather than memorizing them. I am motivated to improve my skills, take on new challenges, and learn from my mistakes. Along with technical learning, I value discipline, patience, and creativity, which help me stay focused on my goals. I aim to continue expanding my knowledge, gaining practical experience, and becoming confident in my abilities as I move forward in my academic and professional journey. </p>
